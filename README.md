# **UI-UX-Experiment6**

## **Aim**

To understand and apply key UX methods including ideation, user stories, scenarios, flow diagrams, and information architecture for a selected problem.

---

## **Algorithm**

### **1. Solution Ideation**

1. Identify a known UX problem (e.g., booking a hospital appointment).
2. Perform Crazy 8s or Brainwriting to generate 8 low-fidelity concepts.
3. Select ideas that improve usability and efficiency.

### **2. Creating User Stories**

1. Identify target users and their goals.
2. Write user stories in the format:
   **As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].**
3. Ensure stories reflect real needs and motivations.

### **3. Creating Scenarios**

1. Select one user story.
2. Construct a narrative describing the user’s environment, emotions, and tasks.
3. Explain how and why the user interacts with the system.

### **4. Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping**

1. Select a task (e.g., ordering food via an app).
2. Identify main steps and decisions.
3. Represent the process using Start → Action → Decision → End symbols.

### **5. Information Architecture**

1. Choose an app or website (e.g., university website).
2. Conduct card sorting (open/closed).
3. Group related items into categories.
4. Create a site map showing the hierarchical structure.

## **Output**

### **1. Ideation (Crazy 8s Concepts – Textual)**

1. One-Tap Appointment Booking
2. Symptom-Based Doctor Suggestions
3. Voice-Based Appointment Booking
4. Calendar-First Interface
5. Chatbot Booking Assistant
6. Emergency Fast-Track Booking
7. Personalized Doctor Recommendations
8. Insurance-Filter Based Recommendations

### **2. User Stories**

* As a patient, I want to book an appointment quickly, so that I can avoid waiting in queues.
* As a returning user, I want to rebook the same doctor, so that I save time.
* As a new user, I want to search for doctors by specialization, so that I can find the right doctor easily.
* As a working professional, I want to view available time slots, so that I can choose a convenient time.
* As an elderly user, I want simple navigation with large buttons, so that I can use the app easily.

### **3. Scenario Example**

Rahul, a 29-year-old software engineer, feels unwell during work. During his lunch break, he uses the hospital app to find a cardiologist. He is stressed and in a hurry. The app shows available time slots clearly, helping him book a 6:30 PM appointment quickly. He feels relieved and confident that he can meet a doctor after office hours.
